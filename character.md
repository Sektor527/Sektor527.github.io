# Features & Traits

## Archetype: Awakened Mind

### Open Mind

Telepathy Discipline

### Mental Awareness

You can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom for Insight checks against creatures with intelligence of 6 or higher.

If you have telepathically communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as them.

### Mind Reader
When you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).

When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).

## Discipline: Telepathy

### Telepathic Communication
You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand  our telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Creatures you communicate with can reply in kind.
    
*From Mental Awareness: if communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane.*

### Telepathic Intrusion
You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target must succeed on a Wisdom or Intelligence (your choice; Mind Reader) saving throw, or take 1d8 psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw, it has disadvantage on attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. You can choose to deal no damage to the creature when it fails its saving throw.

You can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telepathic Intrusion (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

**Meddling (2 psi points):**
You make one creature invisible to the target creature or cause the creature to see something that is not there with the effect of *minor illusion* until the start of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

**Overwhelming (3 psi points):**
The target is stunned until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.

**Rending (1+ psi points):**
The target takes 1d8 psychic damage for each additional point spent on a failed save.

**Terrifying (1 psi point):**
The target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

### Alternate Effects
You can use your Psionics feature to cast the following spells as per the rules defined in the feature:

**1 psi point:** *compelled query*, *command*, *frighten*

**2 psi points:** *detect thoughts*, *suggestion*

If a spell can be cast at higher level, you can spend additional psi points to cast it at a level equal to the psi points spent.

## Discipline: Telekinesis

### Telekinetic Hands

You can manipulate small objects within 30 feet with your mind as if using your hand to interact with it. You can use this power to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can’t Attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds in this manner. You can move an item you are controlling in this way up to 30 feet during your turn.

You can spend 1 or more psi points to increase how much you can move this way by 100 pounds per psi point spent for 1 turn.

### Telekinetic Force

You smash a target creature or object you can see with your mental power. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage, and either be shoved 5 feet in a direction of your choosing or be knocked prone.

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telekinetic Force (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

**Crushing (2 psi points):**
The target is restrained until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.

**Hammering (1+ psi points):**
The target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each point spent if it fails its saving throw.

**Hurling (1-3 psi points):**
The target is shoved 10 feet in a direction of your choosing for each point spent if it fails its saving throw.

**Zone of (1-3 psi points):**
You can target all creatures in a 5-foot radius of a point within range. The radius doubles for each point spent (5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet).


### Alternate Effects

You can use your Psionics feature to cast the following spells as per the rules defined in the feature:

**1 psi point:** *jump*, *launch object*, *thunderwave*

**2 psi points:** *fling*, *levitate*, *shatter*

If a spell can be cast at higher level, you can spend additional psi points to cast it at a level equal to the psi points spent.
## Psionic Talents

### Mental Influence

You specialize in the subtle touch, picking stray thoughts and soothing concerns without overtly intruding upon a mind. You gain expertise in the Persuasion skill, though you are reduced to normal proficiency against creatures that are immune to mental influence or charm (such as a creature under the effect of *mind blank*).

### Telekinetic Movement

You can expend 1 psi point to gain 10 additional feet of movement and the effect of *spider climb*, *feather fall*, or *levitate* until the start of your next turn (no action required). At the start of your next turn, you can expend 1 psi point to maintain the effect before it would end.

## Racial Traits

### Darkvision

Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Hellish Resistance

You have resistance to fire damage.

### Infernal Legacy

You know the *thaumaturgy* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *darkness* spell once with this trait and regains the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Background Traits

### False Identity

You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.
